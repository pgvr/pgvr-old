I recently started using Raycast and I am absolutely in love with it.

> Raycast is a blazingly fast, totally extendable launcher. It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more. - [raycast.com](https://www.raycast.com/)

If you use Mac and the Spotlight function I highly encourage you to try out Raycast as it improves on basically every aspect compared to traditional Spotlight.

A big feature is the the marketplace where the community can upload new extensions for everyone to use. As I use Chakra UI at work and for personal projects I find myself visiting the documentation for Chakra quite often and since there was no Raycast extension to browse the Chakra docs yet I decided to build one.

This is no fancy extension but if you want to get started building your own Raycast extension, hopefully I can give you a few pointers and make the process a little easier for you.

## Prerequisites

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) installed, an editor and familiarity with React & Typescript won’t hurt, that’s it.

To get started you can simply use Raycast to scaffold a starting template.

![/static/images/raycast-extension/create_extension.png](/static/images/raycast-extension/create_extension.png)

Fill out the details and choose the "Hello World" template. Note that I just specified a general folder for the location, Raycast will create a folder for you with the same name as you give the extension.

Hit "Create Extension" or use CMD+Enter to create the template. Navigate to the created folder, install the dependencies and open up your editor.

Replace the contents of `src/index.tsx` with this:

```tsx:src/index.tsx
import { Action, ActionPanel, Icon, List } from "@raycast/api"

const items = [
  {
    title: "Button",
    url: "https://chakra-ui.com/docs/form/button",
  },
]

export default function Command() {
  return (
    <List searchBarPlaceholder="Filter by title...">
      {items.map((item) => (
        <List.Item
          key={item.title}
          icon={{ source: Icon.Link }}
          title={item.title}
          actions={
            <ActionPanel>
              <Action.OpenInBrowser url={item.url} />
            </ActionPanel>
          }
        />
      ))}
    </List>
  )
}
```

And with this little code the extension is practically done. You can try it out by running `npm run dev` and when you open Raycast while this command is running you should see the Hello World command popping up where you can test your extension.

There are a lot of other cool components that Raycast provides so you can let you creativity run free.

If you want to publish an extension I recommend you take a look at the [proper documentation](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/prepare-an-extension-for-store) for that and maybe check beforehand whether this extension [already exists](https://www.raycast.com/store).

That’s it, thanks for reading ✌️
